# Computer Vision Case Studies

Welcome to the Computer Vision Case Studies repository! This collection is curated to help learners and practitioners explore real-world computer vision problems, solutions, and techniques. Here you'll find study materials, annotated notebooks, datasets, and small projects to deepen your understanding of computer vision concepts and applications.

## Contents

- **Case Studies:** Step-by-step walkthroughs of computer vision projects, including problem statements, approaches, code, and results.
- **Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks demonstrating image processing, feature extraction, object detection, and more.
- **Datasets:** Sample datasets for experimentation and practice.
- **Reference Material:** Essential resources for building foundational knowledge.

## Reference Material

- [Hands-On Image Processing with Python](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Image-Processing-with-Python)  
    A practical guide covering image processing techniques in Python, including filtering, transformations, and feature extraction.

- [Fundamentals of Image Processing (PDF)](./reference-material/fundamentals_of_image_processing.pdf)  
    A comprehensive document explaining core concepts, mathematical foundations, preprocessing methods, filtering, and feature extraction.
