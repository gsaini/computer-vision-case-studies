# Problem Statement: Covid-19 Image Classification

## Context

COVID-19 is a rapidly spreading disease that severely impacts human health, often leading to lung infections. While vaccines help strengthen immunity, their effects take time. The virus has also had a significant impact on economies worldwide.

Advancements in technology now assist healthcare professionals in analyzing medical images for better diagnosis. By examining lung X-rays, these methods can help differentiate between healthy individuals, common respiratory infections, and COVID-19, supporting more accurate medical assessments.

## Objective

The aim of this project is to build an Artificial Neural Network to differentiate an X-ray image of a person affected with Covid from that of a healthy person or a person who has viral pneumonia(fever).

## Data Description

This dataset contains the training set images of 3 classes, which are converted into numpy arrays.

- **COVID-19:** The patient who is affected due to Covid.
- **Viral Pneumonia:** This is a viral fever which has similar characteristics like fever and cough of Covid, but is not Covid.
- **Normal:** A healthy Person with no symptoms of Covid or fever.

The data file names are:

- CovidImages.npy
- CovidLabels.csv

## Learning Outcomes

- Image Preprocessing
- Preparing the data to train a model
- Training an Artificial Neural Network
- Model Evaluation
